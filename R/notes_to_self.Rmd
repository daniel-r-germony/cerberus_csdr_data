### Material Cost Table

Each row includes the cost of a vehicle at a given `DetailedStandardCategoryID` and by `OrderLotID`.  

```{r}
material_cost
```

I thought I would use an allocation table to split those costs by `DetailedStandardCategoryID` into the WBS.  

### Example Allocation Table

Here is an example of one of my allocation tables that is mean to allocate costs by `DetailedStandardCategoryID` to `WBSElementID`. The material unit cost for each vehicle is already different so the unit costs would differ. I think I need to do that math and then not call it an allocation (the way FlexFile) thinks of it.

```{r}
gp_wbs_distro
```

### Overheads

Need to figure out how overheads work.

### Labor by Unit

Need to figure out how to map labor costs back to individual units.
